### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**zmyrvold/zmyrvold** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

My name is Zach Myrvold. I am an aerospace engineering major at Iowa State University. This is my fourth year in the program. I am interested in learning how to be more productive with coding and using linux and GitHub. I am also intersted in learning about aerospace structures, aerodynamics, propulsion, and lots more. 
Right now I am working on my classes for the semester. I am taking aerospace computational techniques, flight control, advanced flight structures, and optimization. 
My favorite hobby is playing basketball. I have been playing ever since I was in the fourth grade. I also enjoy watching movies and TV, reading comic books, hanging out with friends, and lots more.
